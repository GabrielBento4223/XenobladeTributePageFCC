<p>Long ago, two titans waged war against one another, until the battle ended in a stalemate, now only their lifeless husks remains. And it's up to the inhabitants of these two titans to end this conflict. This page will give you a tour over some areas in this world.</p>

<li>
<h2>Gaur Plains:</h2> 
<img class="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/fd/f2/83fdf28818bf1ed3a21216c7a6cd7ede.jpg">
A lively green field located on the Bionis' upper leg, as it is bend in a battle stance it creates a large field. In it lies Colony 6, one of the few remaining human settlements. Right below it, on the Bionis' foot, lies Colony 9, the only other homs aka human settlement and the home of our protagonist.

Gaur Plains is huge and there's much to explore, but beware the high level monsters that lurks in this fauna!

<h2>Fallen Arm:</h2>

The lost arm of Mechonis that fell in the ocean during the ancient battle, There lies a settlement too. It is directly beneath Sword Valley, the place where Mechonis' Sword meets the Bionis' chest, a stasis of the last blow delivered. 

Sword Valley is also where a mechon base of operations is located. Mechons beings from the Mechonis that attacks Bionis and it's inhabitants, I wonder why?

<h2>Eryth Sea:</h2>

A vast ocean located in the head of the Bionis. From there you can even see the Mechonis! It glows during the night and has a magical aesthetic to it. There's the capital Alcamoth in it, a floating city where the technologically advanced High Entia live, so far removed from the homs settlements that homs dismissed them as folklore.

in Eryth Sea's center lies Prison Island, a large tower made to imprison something, I wonder what it might be?

<h2>Agniratha:</h2>
<img class="image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GI5boIcH9gw/maxresdefault.jpg">
The Mechonis' capital. A large abandoned city with a huge shrine where the people of Mechonis once worshipped their goddess. Now only battle robots roam around the city with their mission to protect its remainings. 

What fate could have brought upon this city to turn it into a ghost town? And why is it so heavily guarded?
